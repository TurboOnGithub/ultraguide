        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The Leviathan is a massive sea serpent-like creature, composed of many sculpted faces and bodies. Its head resembles an unusual humanoid protrusion with four arms above its jaw. Along its back, instead of a traditional spine, there are additional arms, creating a disturbing silhouette. The underbelly is lined with the faces of the sullen, individuals who have contributed to the Leviathan's ever-growing length.</p>
        <p>Behind the Leviathan's head is a flayed humanoid that serves as its "heart." This figure appears to have burst forth from the mass of the Leviathan but is now pinned back into its flesh by cross-shaped angelic lances.</p>

    <!-- Combat Overview Section -->
    <section class="combat-overview">
        <h2>Combat Overview</h2>
        <p>The Leviathan has a straightforward combat design but is meant to challenge your ability to ignore distractions. While the creature itself is huge and intimidating, you can only damage certain parts of its body. Its skull (but not its mouth) is invulnerable, meaning you must focus on attacking other areas to deal damage.</p>
        <p>Its attacks are easy to predict but can be difficult to evade due to the Leviathan's massive size and varied move set. Staying calm and avoiding getting overwhelmed by the distractions is key to surviving this fight.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Attacks Section -->
    <section class="attacks">
        <h2>Attacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lunge:</strong> The Leviathan telegraphs a lunge attack with a blue flash and a "pling" sound. It takes a moment for the Leviathan to retract its head. This attack is parryable, but with strict timing. However, parrying does not interrupt the attack itself.</li>
            <li><strong>Hell Orb Barrage:</strong> The Leviathan launches a huge barrage of Hell Orbs. These projectiles have a small spread, making it a challenge to dodge them if you're caught in their path.</li>
            <li><strong>Tail Swing:</strong> The Leviathan swings its tail in either a high or low direction. A clockwise swing is low, while a counterclockwise swing is high. This attack is very damaging and can be hard to predict, especially in the chaos of the fight.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Difficulty Changes Section -->
    <section class="difficulty-changes">
        <h2>Difficulty Changes</h2>
        <p>The Leviathan's behavior changes based on the difficulty level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Higher difficulties:</strong> The Leviathan becomes faster and more aggressive, making it harder to dodge its attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower difficulties:</strong> The Leviathan moves slower, giving you more time to react and strategize.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Rending Apart Section -->
    <section class="rending-apart">
        <h2>Rending Apart</h2>
        <p>The Leviathan requires patience and precision to defeat. Focus on its exposed limbs and torso while avoiding the head and the tail swings. Use ranged weapons like the Railcannon or Nailgun to attack its limbs from a safe distance, and parry or dodge its lunging attack with careful timing.</p>
        <p>As the Leviathan has a predictable attack cycle—lunging or barraging three times before submerging, followed by two tail swings—it’s important to learn its rhythm and act accordingly. When the creature reappears after submerging, be prepared to avoid the next tail swing while continuing to damage its limbs.</p>
        <p>When fighting on higher difficulties, focus on maintaining consistent damage while keeping track of the increased speed of the Leviathan's attacks. Stay aware of the attack patterns, and don’t let the distractions overwhelm you. Timing is key, and managing your stamina for dodges and parries will determine the outcome of the battle.</p>
