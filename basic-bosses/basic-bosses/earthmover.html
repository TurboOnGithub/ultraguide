        <h2>1000-THR Defence System</h2>
        <p>The fight begins with the Earthmover's Defence System, designed to protect its core. Here's a breakdown of the system's components and how to dismantle them:</p>
        <img src="images/earthmover_defence_mainframe.png" alt="Earthmover Defence System">
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Defence System consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two mounted rocket launchers</li>
            <li>Two mortar launchers firing high-damage projectiles</li>
            <li>Two homing energy pylons</li>
            <li>A central laser beam cannon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The laser cannon remains active until other components are destroyed, increasing its lethality over time.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Defence System Strategy</h3>
        <p>To disable the system, target its components in an efficient order. Focus on these key parts:</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Rocket Launchers</h4>
        <p>The rocket launchers deal continuous damage. Use precise weapons like the Sharpshooter Revolver or explosives to quickly disable them.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Mortars</h4>
        <p>The mortars fire slower but deadlier projectiles. Parry them to send damage back to the system or use long-range weapons to destroy them while staying mobile.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Homing Pylons</h4>
        <p>The homing pylons track your movement and can be overwhelming if ignored. Use rapid-fire or rail weapons to take them out as soon as possible.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Laser Beam Cannon</h4>
        <p>Once the other components are destroyed, the laser cannon becomes vulnerable. Dodge its tracking beam and use high-damage precision weapons to destroy it.</p>

        <h2>The Earthmover</h2>
        <p>After dismantling the Defence System, the fight transitions to the Earthmover's brain, protected by rotating laser walls and additional hazards. This phase is all about timing and precision.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Laser Walls</h3>
        <p>The laser walls rotate around the arena, leaving small gaps for you to dodge through. Practice timing your jumps and slides to avoid taking damage.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Homing Orbs</h3>
        <p>The brain periodically fires large homing orbs. These can be evaded using the arena's structures for cover or with quick lateral movement.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Idol Shields</h3>
        <p>The brain is occasionally protected by Idols, which spawn in destructible containers. Destroy these Idols to remove the shield while using the containers for cover against other hazards.</p>
