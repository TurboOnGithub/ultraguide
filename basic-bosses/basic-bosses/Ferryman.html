        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Ferryman is a recurring **Basic Boss** in ULTRAKILL, first encountered in the level <strong>5-2: WAVES OF THE STARLESS SEA</strong>. This skeletal figure wields a large oar and relentlessly chases V1 on his ship, offering a thrilling battle with two distinct phases. The fight involves dodging lightning, destroying idols, and avoiding numerous attacks from the Ferryman.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The Ferryman is a skeletal humanoid with blue bones, wearing a small white robe covering his torso. He has golden, ring-like artifacts around his limbs, and a crescent moon-shaped figure atop his hood. He wields a large, white boat oar, which is central to his attacks. His eerie presence and his glowing blue bones make him a visually striking boss.</p>

    <section class="combat-guide">
        <h2>Combat Overview</h2>
        <p>The Ferryman battle is split into two phases, starting on the deck of his ship and transitioning to the roof. You will need to destroy idols, avoid his lightning strikes, and carefully time your parries to defeat him.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Phase 1: Deck Battle</h3>
        <p>In the first phase, you must battle the Ferryman on the deck of his ship. He will frequently combat roll and strike with his oar. The key to survival is avoiding his attacks while trying to get close enough to destroy the first Idol, which will allow you to progress to the next phase.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Phase 2: Roof Battle</h3>
        <p>Once you deplete his first HP bar, the Ferryman will retreat to the roof of the ship. In this phase, he will attempt to strike V1 with lightning, which can be avoided by staying away from the white lines marking where the lightning will strike. The second Idol will appear on the roof, and destroying it will trigger the second phase of the fight.</p>

    <!-- Attacks Section -->
    <section class="attacks">
        <h2>The Ferryman's Attacks</h2>
        <p>The Ferryman has several unique attacks, and he will choose them based on V1's movements. Here is a list of his attacks and how to counter them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overhead Oar Swing & Horizontal Swipe:</strong> The first swing can't be parried, but the second can. Use parrying to avoid the second attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Upwards Kick & Downward Kick:</strong> The first kick can't be parried, but the second one can. Timing is key for the parry.</li>
            <li><strong>Dash Backward & Spinning Oar Strike:</strong> This attack launches V1 and can be parried if done at close range.</li>
            <li><strong>Oar Slam:</strong> The Ferryman will slam his oar into the ground in front of him, creating an explosion. This can be parried, but be cautious of the explosion's radius.</li>
            <li><strong>Distance-closing Spinning Oar Strike:</strong> This strike can only be used if V1 is far away and can't be parried. Keep your distance to avoid it.</li>
            <li><strong>Thrust with Oar:</strong> If V1 is walking away, this thrust can be parried.</li>
            <li><strong>Jumping Thrust with Oar:</strong> This attack targets airborne V1 and cannot be parried. Stay grounded to avoid it.</li>
            <li><strong>Lightning Summon:</strong> If V1 is out of range for a while, the Ferryman will summon lightning. It can be charged back but will not grant a style bonus. On Brutal difficulty, he may do this at any time.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Strategy Section -->
    <section class="strategy">
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>In addition to learning his attack patterns, here's a breakdown of the best strategy to defeat the Ferryman:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep Moving:</strong> Always be on the move, especially during the lightning phase. Staying mobile will help you dodge both his oar attacks and the lightning.</li>
            <li><strong>Destroy the Idols:</strong> Destroy the idols quickly to avoid giving the Ferryman more strength. You will need to jump on barrels to reach the second Idol on the roof.</li>
            <li><strong>Parry Effectively:</strong> Parrying the Ferryman's oar attacks and the thrusts is crucial to staying alive. Watch out for his spinning oar strike and the oar slam as these are the main threats when you approach him.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the Environment:</strong> During the lightning phase, use the ship's environment to block the lightning or stay away from the dangerous lines.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Endgame Tactics</h3>
        <p>As you transition to the second phase and the Ferryman starts summoning lightning, remember to take your time with each strike. Focus on dodging and destroying the idols at the right moments. His lightning bolts are a high-damage AoE, so maintaining a safe distance is key.</p>
