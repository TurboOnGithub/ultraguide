    <!-- Phase 1 Section -->
    <section class="phase-one">
        <h2>Phase 1: Cart Chase</h2>
        <p>The first phase of the fight takes place on moving carts with environmental hazards. Falling off the carts or colliding with obstacles deals significant damage, making mobility key.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Key Attacks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Acid Puddle:</strong> Creates an acid pool that deals damage over time. Stay clear of it.</li>
            <li><strong>Shoulder Arm Swings:</strong> A three-hit melee combo that can be dodged or parried.</li>
            <li><strong>Back Swipe:</strong> A quick attack aimed at punishing players who attempt to flank.</li>
            <li><strong>Hammer Slam:</strong> A heavy vertical attack that can destroy the cart you're on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stay on the carts and focus on avoiding the environmental dangers while chipping away at the Minotaur’s health.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Phase 2 Section -->
    <section class="phase-two">
        <h2>Phase 2: Rematch</h2>
        <p>The second phase takes place in a larger arena, where the Minotaur becomes even more aggressive. Its attacks become deadlier, but the open space gives you more room to maneuver.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Key Attacks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hammer Flurry:</strong> A fast series of hammer swings that cover a wide area.</li>
            <li><strong>Ground Slam Explosion:</strong> A high-damage attack that creates a lingering red energy burst.</li>
            <li><strong>Acid Cloud/Pool:</strong> An upgraded version of the acid attack, dealing more damage over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Charge:</strong> A high-speed rush attack that can be parried or dodged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use the larger arena to maintain distance and target the Minotaur’s weak points during attack cooldowns.</p>

    <!-- Tips Section -->
    <section class="tips">
        <h2>Strategies & Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Lure the Minotaur to the central cart to limit its movement. Use ranged explosives for consistent damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Aim for its underbelly and face. Parrying the Charge attack deals significant damage and creates openings.</li>
            <li><strong>Weapon Choices:</strong> The Sharpshooter Revolver and Malicious Railcannon are excellent for hitting weak spots.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Mobile:</strong> Keep moving to avoid wide-reaching attacks and acid hazards.</li>
            <li><strong>Healing:</strong> Take advantage of attack cooldowns to heal if needed.</li>
        </ul>
