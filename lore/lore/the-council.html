            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Council was a group of angels that ruled Heaven with an iron fist in God's absence. Their authority extended over all of Heaven, enforced through fear and tyranny. They were ultimately overthrown and slaughtered by their enforcer, Gabriel, after he discovered their corruption and hypocrisy. This act of rebellion marked a pivotal moment in ULTRAKILL’s lore, highlighting the themes of justice, power, and rebellion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The members of the Council are depicted wearing <strong>gold, white, and royal purple robes</strong>. Their attire features a semi-standardized cloak design, emphasizing their status and unity as the ruling authority. While there are variations among individual members, the Council as a whole exudes an air of divine regality. Their figures are often depicted as faceless, dehumanizing their image and reinforcing their oppressive, authoritarian rule.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Council's reign and downfall form a significant part of ULTRAKILL’s story:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reign:</strong> The Council ruled Heaven in the Father’s absence, maintaining order through fear and enforcing their will via angels like Gabriel.</li>
                <li><strong>Corruption:</strong> Their tyranny and oppressive methods became evident to Gabriel after his second defeat by V1 in Heresy.</li>
                <li><strong>Downfall:</strong> Gabriel, disillusioned and enraged, rebelled against the Council. He slaughtered all its members, presenting the severed head of the last councilman to the onlooking crowd, ending their rule and exposing their hypocrisy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Members</h2>
            <p>While no member of the Council is named, visual depictions from the cutscenes provide some insight:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the cutscene after <strong>[3-2: IN THE FLESH]</strong>, at least 17 figures are visible in the background, likely all members of the Council.</li>
                <li>In <strong>[6-2: AESTHETICS OF HATE]</strong>, only six figures, including the councilman being killed, are present on screen. This suggests that multiple bodies may be off-screen or already slain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Council's faceless appearance and standardized robes symbolize their anonymity and collective power, but also their detachment from the people they ruled over.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
            <p>Despite being rulers of Heaven, the Council's powers remain enigmatic:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Holy Light Removal:</strong> The Council is capable of stripping holy light from individuals they deem unworthy, as seen in the cutscene after <strong>[3-2: IN THE FLESH]</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliance on Enforcers:</strong> They appear to lack significant combat abilities themselves, relying on enforcers like Gabriel for protection and enforcement of their rule.</li>
                <li><strong>Earth Time Usage:</strong> The Council uses Earth time measurements, such as hours, suggesting a connection or influence from Earth despite their heavenly domain.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>In-Game References</h2>

                <li><strong>[6-2: AESTHETICS OF HATE]:</strong> Gabriel slaughters the Council in a violent rebellion, exposing their hypocrisy and ending their oppressive reign.</li>
