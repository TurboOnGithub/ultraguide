            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>King Sisyphus, the leader of the Sisyphean Insurrectionists, stands as a symbol of defiance and resistance in ULTRAKILL’s lore. Unlike the peaceful Minos, Sisyphus sought to overthrow Heaven’s control of Hell through force, amassing an army to challenge the divine oppressors. Though ultimately doomed, his struggle embodies the joy of rebellion against an impossible foe, making him one of the game’s most compelling figures.</p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>In life, Sisyphus was a cunning and ambitious king, depicted in Hell with his eyes burned out by molten gold to symbolize his greed. His corpse, found in <strong>[4-4: CLAIR DE SOLEIL]</strong>, is mangled and bound with barbed wire, missing its head and legs but adorned with metallic structures. As Sisyphus Prime, his Prime Soul exudes raw power and defiance, embodying his will to resist even in death.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Life and Punishment</h3>
            <p>Sisyphus’ legend begins with his hubris and deceit in life, which earned him Zeus’ wrath. Condemned to eternally push a boulder up a hill in Tartarus, he demonstrated unrelenting tenacity. Transferred to the Greed layer in ULTRAKILL’s continuity, he used his punishment as a guise to bide his time and plan an uprising against Heaven.</p>
            <h3>The Sisyphean Insurrection</h3>
            <p>During the chaos of God’s Disappearance, Sisyphus mobilized an army of Husks, calling them the Sisyphean Insurrectionists. His forces grew by recruiting the strong-willed damned and training them to fight both demons and angels. The rebellion shook Hell, and his charisma made him a beacon of hope for freedom.</p>
            <h3>Defeat and Death</h3>
            <p>When Heaven reestablished order, Gabriel led an army of angels to crush the rebellion. Though the insurrection was valiant, it faltered due to inexperience and dependency on Sisyphus’ leadership. Gabriel personally beheaded Sisyphus, displaying his head to demoralize the Insurrectionists. Without their leader, the army collapsed, leaving the survivors to resume their eternal punishment, now haunted by their failure.</p>

Sisyphus’ monologues during the encounter offer insight into his beliefs, highlighting his joy in resisting even in the face of certain defeat.</p>
            <h3>Legacy in Hell</h3>
            <p>Sisyphus’ corpse appears in <strong>[4-4: CLAIR DE SOLEIL]</strong>, serving as a grim reminder of his rebellion. His story is referenced in books, paintings, and by remnants of his followers, who still bear the scars of their failed insurrection.</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was punished by Zeus for cheating death twice and seducing his niece Tyro to usurp his brother, Salmoneus. These aspects are not carried over into ULTRAKILL's lore.</li>
                <li>Sisyphus’ punishment in ULTRAKILL—hauling boulders in the Greed layer—is a continuation of his mythological sentence but adapted to fit the game’s setting.</li>
                <li>His burned-out eyes symbolize being metaphorically blinded by greed in life.</li>
                <li>The line “One must imagine Sisyphus happy” from his terminal data is a direct reference to Albert Camus’ philosophical essay *The Myth of Sisyphus*. Camus argues that Sisyphus’ defiance and embrace of his struggle embody the spirit of absurdism.</li>
                <li>In <strong>[4-4: CLAIR DE SOLEIL]</strong>, Sisyphus' corpse features fully rendered arms, though they are obscured in-game.</li>
                <li>Sisyphus’ followers drag the remains of Malicious Faces up pyramids in a nod to his mythological punishment.</li>
                <li>Sisyphus’ personality contrasts with the ancient myth; ULTRAKILL's Sisyphus delights in his struggle, while the mythological Sisyphus is frustrated by it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Speculation</h2>
            <p>The fate of Sisyphus raises questions about the themes of ULTRAKILL and the future of its narrative:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Could remnants of the Sisyphean Insurrection resurface in future layers or Prime Soul encounters?</li>
                <li>Does Sisyphus’ philosophy influence other rebellious figures in Hell, such as Minos Prime?</li>
                <li>How does his struggle reflect on Gabriel’s character arc and the overarching conflict between Heaven and Hell?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
