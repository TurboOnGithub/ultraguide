            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Lucifer, a character mentioned in the Secret Terminal found in <strong>[5-S: I ONLY SAY MORNING]</strong>, is a reimagined version of the famous figure from Christian tradition. In ULTRAKILL, he is portrayed as a bright and beautiful angel who opposed The Father’s creation of Hell, questioning the necessity of eternal torment for temporary sins. This act of defiance led to his banishment, casting him into a bottomless pit. The Father, overcome with regret, lamented his actions but could not undo them. Lucifer's legacy in ULTRAKILL intertwines themes of rebellion, morality, and divine fallibility.</p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Lucifer's physical appearance is currently unknown, as he has not been depicted in-game. Based on his description as a "bright and beautiful angel," it can be speculated that his design would incorporate elements of radiance and divinity, contrasting with the darkness of his eventual fate. If he does appear in Act III, his visual design might reflect his fall from grace, embodying both celestial beauty and tragic despair.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Lucifer’s story, as told in the Testament found in <strong>[5-S: I ONLY SAY MORNING]</strong>, highlights his opposition to the idea of eternal torment:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                "FATHER, WHY ETERNAL TORMENT? IS IT NOT CRUEL?<br>
                IS TORTURE UNENDING TRULY A FATE FIT FOR A FOOL?<br>
                <br>
                AN ANGEL SO BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL ASKED ME THIS . . .<br>
                AND I COULD FIND NO ANSWER<br>
                FOR I COULD NEVER FACE THE GUILT OF WHAT I'D DONE . . .<br>
                MY REGRET, A GNAWING CANCER<br>
                <br>
                IN MY HOUR OF WEAKNESS, TERROR POSSESSED ME THEN<br>
                AND I CAST LUCIFER, TOO, INTO THE INFERNAL DEN<br>
                <br>
                ONCE I REALIZED WHAT I HAD JUST DONE . . .<br>
                I COULD ONLY WEEP<br>
                AS I SANK SLOWLY INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR . . .<br>
                DEEP, OH SO DEEP"
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The Father, consumed by fear and guilt, cast Lucifer into Hell, an act he immediately regretted. Lucifer’s fate remains unknown, but his story reveals his compassion for humanity and his willingness to challenge divine authority for their sake.</p>

            <h2>Role in ULTRAKILL</h2>
            <p>Lucifer’s only direct mention in ULTRAKILL so far is in the Secret Terminal and Gabriel’s voice line: <strong>"You make even the Devil cry!"</strong>. This suggests that, within ULTRAKILL’s interpretation of Christianity, Lucifer is regarded as the Devil, though his motivations and actions diverge from the traditional portrayal.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secret Terminal:</strong> Lucifer’s story is recounted in the Testament found at the exit elevator of <strong>[5-S: I ONLY SAY MORNING]</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Possible Future Appearance:</strong> Given his connection to Dante's Inferno, it is speculated that Lucifer might appear in the depths of Treachery in Act III, potentially as a significant boss or ally.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The name "Lucifer" comes from the Latin term for the morning star (Venus). In Isaiah 14:12, the King of Babylon is metaphorically referred to as the morning star, which later became associated with the Devil.</li>
                <li>Unlike traditional portrayals, ULTRAKILL’s Lucifer opposed God not out of pride or ambition but out of compassion, questioning the justice of eternal punishment for mortal sins.</li>
                <li>In Dante’s Inferno, Lucifer is depicted as frozen in the depths of Treachery, which could influence his role in Act III.</li>
                <li>Lucifer’s opposition to eternal torment reflects a significant thematic departure, portraying him as a tragic figure rather than a villain.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Could he serve as a boss at the end of Act III, echoing his placement in Dante’s Inferno?</li>
