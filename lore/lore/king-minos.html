            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>In life, King Minos was depicted as a dignified ruler, often shown in paintings and statues with thorns wrapped around his eyes, symbolizing justice being blind.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Life as a Ruler</h3>
            <p>King Minos was known for his fairness and dedication to justice. After the Disappearance of God, he led a renaissance in the Lust layer, transforming it from a place of torment into a thriving civilization. His efforts to alleviate the suffering of sinners challenged Heaven's dogma, drawing the ire of the ruling Council.</p>
            <h3>Downfall</h3>
            <p>Minos’ reforms were seen as heretical by Heaven, prompting the Council to send Gabriel to execute him. Despite Minos’ attempts to reason with the angel, Gabriel struck him down without hesitation. His dying moments were marked by anguish and defiance, cursing the injustice of Heaven’s rule.</p>
            <h3>Posthumous Tragedy</h3>
            <p>After his death, Minos’ soul was imprisoned within his body, preventing it from ascending to Prime status. The parasitic snakes he once controlled took over his corpse, turning it into a destructive force that ravaged the very civilization he built. Trapped within, Minos could only watch in horror, vowing revenge on those who had betrayed him.</p>
